Day 4 Assignment Notes
	Create an RDS on a private network and create a EC2 instance on a public subnet with access 
to internet. EC2 instance must be able to access RDS instance, but RDs instance may not have public
access. Once those two are communicating, create an application to display DB connection to the public.


Day 4 Assignment Steps

	-First, I created a VPC
	-Next, I created two subnets on the VPC, one private and one public.
	-After that, I created two route tables. One public and one private.
	-Once I created the route tables, I created an Internet Gateway and attached it to the VPC
	-Next, I attached route tables to their respective subnets.
	-Then, I set the public route table as the main route table.
	-Then, I created an EC2 and RDS instace.
	-After that, I creted a security policy for EC2 to allow traffic on SSH port and HTTP port
	-Once that was added, I edited the security group for RDS and added the ID for the EC2 security 
		group so that it allows all traffic (this is called a nested security group).
	-Once that was completed, I ran mysql command fron EC2 terminal to make sure that it was able
		to connect to RDS instance, and it was successful.
	-Once the EC2 instance had connection with RDS, I installed NGINX on the EC2 instance, and 
		modified the configuration to run serve a php script that I created. This php file is a
		a simple db connection that queries the tables table on the informatio_schema.
	-After the script file was finished and configuration was updated, I was able to access the 
		application from the internet and it displays table names from the RDS instance. This mean
		that I bealieve the assignment conditions were met.
