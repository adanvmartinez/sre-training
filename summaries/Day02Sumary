My understanding of SRE Day Two Topics

IAM is an identity and Access management tool similar to active directory used to allows users
to resources. It explicitly denies access, unless whitelisted. Root account is initially the only
one responsible for billing setting, unless another IAM user us granted permission to do such task.
Within IAM, User accounts can be created, as well as Groups of users and Roles. These groups can be 
assigned certain access policies. These policies can be created within the IAM service, and they limit
access to services.

Virtual Private Cloud
VPCs can be created in existing reagions managed by AWS (us-west, us-east, etc..)
These VPCs can contain Virtual subnets within them. These can be isolated from the internet. A link \
can be created between subnets to allow for internet access through a NAT table.

NAT Gateways
These are used to give internet access to subnets. This way, the private connection of subnets is 
translated into a public address/traffic. These NAT gateways are managed by AWS, whereas, if an NAT 
instance is created, it would have to be managed by the user that created it.
