Day 5 Assignment Instructions
  Further impro assignment from day 4 by implementing insertion into the RDS database.

My implementation: 
  I moved away from my PHP script from the previous day and decided to set up a Node server instead.
I used NGINX as a reverse proxy server that directs requests to localhost on port 3000, where the node
application will listen on. After configuring NGINX, I wrote the node application to take get requests
for the html and another for the javascript file that takes care of making another get request to get the
data from database to the front end. After that, I updated the landing page route to make a insert
statement to the database every time a quest comes in. The result can be viewed on the website.
